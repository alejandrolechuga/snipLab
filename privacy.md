Privacy Policy for HTTPMocky
Last updated: May 30, 2025

HTTPMocky is a browser extension designed for developers to intercept and override HTTP requests made through fetch and XMLHttpRequest. We take user privacy seriously and aim to be fully transparent about how data is handled.

What data do we collect?
At this time, HTTPMocky does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or identifiable user data. All extension functionality operates locally in your browser and is used solely for development and debugging purposes.

Will telemetry or analytics be added?
We may introduce optional telemetry in the future to help us improve the extension by collecting anonymous usage metrics. If this happens:

You will be explicitly notified

Data collection will be strictly opt-in

We will not collect personal information, browsing history, or any content unrelated to the extension's features

This policy will be updated accordingly, and users will be given the opportunity to review changes.
