# SnipLab

SnipLab is a developer-focused Chrome extension that lets you create, manage,
and run JavaScript snippets directly within any webpage.

It provides:

- A simple interface for writing and editing code snippets
- One-click execution in the context of the active tab
- Script persistence across sessions
- Future support for AI-assisted script generation, sharing across teams, and
  trigger-based automation

SnipLab is designed to boost productivity during debugging, prototyping,
testing, or automation â€” giving you full control of script execution without
needing external tools or manual injection.
